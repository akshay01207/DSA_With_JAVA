 Move all negative numbers
Send Feedback
You are given an array 'ARR' consisting of 'N' integers. You need to rearrange the array elements such 
that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.
Follow Up:
Can you solve this in O(1) auxiliary space?
Note:
The order of elements in the resulting array is not important.
Example:
Let the array be [1, 2, -3, 4, -4, -5]. On rearranging the array such that all negative numbers appear 
before all positive numbers we get the resulting array [-3, -5, -4, 2, 4, 1].
Input format:
The very first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases. 

The first line of every test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number of elements present in the array.

The second line of every test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements present in 
the array.
Output format:
For each test case, “Yes” is printed if the resulting array is correct otherwise “No”.

Output for each test case is printed on a separate line.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 5 * 10^4
-10^5 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5

Where  ‘T’ represents the number of test cases and ‘N’ represents the number of elements present in the array.

Sample Input 1:
2
5
1 -4 -2 5 3
2
2 1    
Sample Output 1:
Yes
Yes
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
For the first test case we have, array: [1, -4, -2, 5, 3] and N = 5. On rearranging the array such that
 all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers we get the resulting array [-2, -4, 1, 5, 3].

For the second test case we have, array: [2, 1] and N = 2. There are no negative numbers. Hence, we do not
 require any rearrangement.
Sample Input 2:
3
4
1 -5 -5 3
5
-1 -2 3 4 5
1
-2
Sample Output 2:
Yes 
Yes
Yes
Explanation for Sample Input 2:
For the first test case we have, array: [1, -5, -5,  3] and N = 4. On rearranging the array such that all 
negative numbers appear before all positive numbers we get the resulting array [-5, -5, 1, 3].

For the second test case we have, array: [-1, -2, 3, 4, 5] and N = 5. There are already arranged in required way.
 Hence, we do not require any rearrangement.

For the third test case we have, array: [-2 ] and N = 1. The array is already arranged in required way. 
Hence, we do not require any rearrangement.
