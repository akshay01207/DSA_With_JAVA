 Yet another Pattern
Send Feedback
Ninja was playing with her sister to solve a puzzle pattern. However, even after taking several hours, they could not solve the problem.
A value of N is given to them, and they are asked to solve the problem. Since they are stuck for a while, they ask you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?
Example : Pattern for N = 4

   *
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer ‘T,’ denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’.
Output Format:
For each test case, print 'N' strings corresponding to every row in a new line (row elements not separated by space)

Print the output of each test case in a separate line.
Note:
You are not required to print the expected output; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 300

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
3
2
Sample Output 1:
* * *
 * *     
  *

* *
 *     
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
 In the first test case, the value of ‘N’ is 3, so three rows are to be printed from 1 to 3 where each row starts from 3, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [“***”,”**”,”*”].

 In the second test case, the value of ‘N’ is 2, so the two rows are to be printed from 1 to 3 where each row starts from 3, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [“**”,”*”].
Sample Input 2:

2
4
5
Sample Output 2:
* * * *
